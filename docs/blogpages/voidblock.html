      <h2>The first shader I made.</h2>
      <p>When I was first learning HLSL, this was the project I was using to learn.
        It is not based on any tutorial and includes multiple techniques I learned while playing wround with the code.</p>
      <p>I first worked on the center object, a sort of hole inspired by the teleporters in Twilight Princess.
        I figured out how to make the red lines seem as if they were "transferring data" by using a gradient.</p>

      <h2>Combining this texture with a lerp makes the lines move.</h2>
      <p>The rest of the shader uses a screen space calculation to set the rgb values.
        First, the screen coordinates are converted into a value between 0 and 255 by adding the x and y coordinates together.
        Then, this value becomes the hue in an HSL color model.</p>

      <h2>Using a helper function to convert from hsl to rgb.</h2>
      <p>Once the HSL with the proper hue is converted to RGB, the value is outputted in the pixel shader stage.</p>
      <p>The last part I finished was the expansion as well as the color change of the cubes.
        After learning that I could set material values through C# scripts, I tried it out by setting a value controlling the color in a script that also expanded the circle.</p>
      <p>I was pretty happy with the result, especially after learning many shader concepts through this project.</p>
