      <h2>Making multiple shaders and expanding into realtime VFX.</h2>
      <p>I wanted to make a much more dynamic scene, so I also forayed into animation for the first time.
        Animation isn't my strong suit, but I was willing to learn it to complete this project.
        The animation and rigging of the model quickly became the most time consuming part of the project.</p>
      <p>The shaders, on the other hand, were more simple to work with.</p>

      <h2>The bow with two shader passes: one for the internal texture and one for the outline.</h2>
      <p>The bow is "spawned" in through vertex displacement along the surface normals.
        What I wanted to achieve during this time was a glow with the bow.
        At the time, I did not know how to make a post processing effect, so instead I opted for an outline.
        This is something I hope to achieve soon.</p>
      <p>The ground breaking was achieved from a C# script rotating and translating the individual ground pieces.</p>
      <p>All in all, this project was an experiment to see what I could do with my current knowledge at the time.
        While I achieved the basics of what I wanted to see, there was a lack of polish due to my inexperience with animation and no knowlege of post processing effects.</p>
