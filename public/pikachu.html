      <h2>Based on the style of Pokemon Mystery Dungeon DX.</h2>
      <p>This shader was my first attempt to replicate the graphics of another game.</p>
      <p>For this project, I used Shader Graph, a node based shader integrated into the Unity engine.
        I had been learning the ropes of shader graph, and I thought it would be a good idea to try using it to replicate an existing game's lighting style.</p>
      <p>The result was surprisingly simple, yet a little lackluster.</p>

      <h2>The amount of nodes needed to get a similar effect was smaller than expected.</h2>
      <p>Combining perlin noise and fresnel lighting created a crayon-like texture while highlighting the edges.
        Darker lighting makes the crayon texture more prominent. </p>
      <p>Despite successfully replicating these two properties, shader graph's simplicity removes any ability to create custom post processing effects.
        This includes an outline effect, which I substituted with a fresnel node.
        However, it became clear that this replacement was not enough.</p>

      <h2>Dark spots on tail resulting from normal based outline.</h2>
      <p>The outline method I chose only works on rounded objects, but even so, it still creates inconsistent outline width.
        I will likely retry the project again in the future to iron out these kinks.</p>
